## Lighthouse Scores

As of Aug 3, 2024, Lighthouse is giving a score of 90 (Performance) / 95 (Accessibility), 100 (Best Practices), and 100 (SEO).

## Todo

* Matching game is broken
* Dark mode is incomplete (select boxes are not proper for dark mode)
* Add many more words!
* Add a way to star cards in order to keep them through shuffles
* Add a way to annotate whether a card has been seen
* Extract configuration selects to a modal (perhaps launched by clickling gear button)--to simplify UI
* Fix problem on matching game where clicking card shuffles card
